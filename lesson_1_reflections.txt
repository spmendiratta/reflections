How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

<diff -u file1 file2>

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term ?

Upon discovering an error, version control will aid in spotting the error source.
Peace of mind knowing there is entire history of changes made to the module(s).

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
In development, logical stops are the best commit points which have to be done manually. Automic saves make sense in a continuously edited document (Google Docs).

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is designed primarily for tracking changes to software modules. A software project typically has interrealted multiple files. Google Docs, in contrast, manages individual documents that may or may not be interrelated.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log 
-- history of all the commits with message, author, commitIDs
git diff <commitID1> <commitID2>
-- displays difference in files between the two commits 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
We can always revert to a working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
All Android development
